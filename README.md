# LiIon_Battery_SOC_EKF_Estimation_MATLAB
This project models a Li-ion battery using a first-order Thevenin equivalent circuit and applies EKF for real-time SOC estimation. Designed for Battery Management System (BMS) applications in Electric Vehicles (EVs), with validation against Coulomb Counting and real-world dataset inputs (voltage, current, temperature).
